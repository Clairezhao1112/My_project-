Problem & Market Opportunity
NYU students rely heavily on RateMyProfessor to pick classes, but the site makes it hard to see how professors’ ratings change over time. Students want more than just a snapshot, they want to know if a professor is getting better, staying consistent, or trending down. Having this insight helps with smarter course planning.

- Market size: NYU has about 50,000 students. If even 20% (10,000 students) used this tool, that’s a big audience.  
- At $1 per student, that’s potentially $10,000 per semester at NYU alone. Scaling to other schools could make this much bigger.

Why Scraping is Needed
RateMyProfessor doesn’t provide an easy API for trends over time. The data is public, but only accessible one page at a time. Scraping allows us to collect ratings with timestamps and turn them into a time series that shows trends clearly.

Potential Users & Willingness to Pay
- Students – the main audience. They’re willing to pay a small fee (like $1) for insights that help them pick classes more confidently.  
- Clubs & advising groups – can use aggregated reports to guide many students at once.  
- Departments – could buy bulk access to see trends across their faculty.

Students are price-sensitive, so keeping it cheap ($1) makes it accessible to almost everyone.

Competitive Analysis
- RMP directly – free, but only snapshots, not trends.  
- Reddit/Discord chats – incomplete and inconsistent.    

Our advantage is turning reviews into clear, visual trend data, something none of the current options provide.

Pricing Model
- Core model: $1 per student for full trend access per professor.  
- Freemium: free for a few trend graphs, then pay a subscription fee for unlimited access.  
- Institutional licensing: departments or student groups can pay for group dashboards.
