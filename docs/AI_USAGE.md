"I am scraping rate my professor and I only want the trends of the rating and only for New york university"
This gave a list of all the rating for each professor and this isn't what I wanted 
I prompt AI again to focus on the average for each semester rating. This time the responses that came out was more concised and organized with the current rating and the by semester rating however the code was longer to 300 lines rather than 200 lines
"Make this code shorter to under 200 lines and fix the code to sort the trend based on each course the professor teach"
