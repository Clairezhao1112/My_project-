In the first prompt, I copied the page source of RMP into Claude AI and asked for “only the trends of the rating and only for New York University.”This just gave a list of all the ratings for each professor, and this was just the most basic information to be scraped.  The second prompt was to focus on the average for each semester rating, which improved the structure of the response; however, the code that worked was about 500 lines of code. In order to test the performance, I prompt AI again to delete unnecessary code(such as unneeded exception handling and redundant blocks), which shortens it to about 300 lines of code. At this point,  the output was the same as what came before, but the output did it for hundreds of professors at NYU.

	AI primarily contributed to the GraphQL query structure, which fetched the professor's rating and exported the results. This includes creating the validation rules for scraped data, exponential backoff, and a basic data transformation pipeline, which are logics that I have never worked with before. My own contribution was focused on improving the code structure by including a semester-by-semester trend on top of the average rating and setting a limit to the retrieval. The current limit is set at 5 top professors with the most ratings, which shortens the code to under 200 lines. Some bugs that remain were that the “difficulty” for each course was always null from the RMP’s GraphQL endpoints, and I had to exclude it from the current version rather than leaving it incomplete in the dataset. For the next step, I hope to turn the scraper into a simple API where I prompt the user to input a professor's name to be searched, and on the front-end, include an actual line graph for the rating trends.
