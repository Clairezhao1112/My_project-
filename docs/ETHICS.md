1. Legal Analysis
When scraping or processing data, we must comply with intellectual property, contract, and privacy laws. Specifically:

- **Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), 18 U.S.C. § 1030**  
  Prohibits unauthorized access to computer systems. Scraping behind authentication walls or ignoring technical access controls could trigger liability.

- **Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), 17 U.S.C. § 1201**  
  Prevents circumvention of technological protection measures. If scraping circumvents CAPTCHAs or login barriers, it may raise DMCA concerns.

- **Terms of Service (TOS) Enforcement**  
  Many websites explicitly forbid automated scraping. Courts (e.g., *Facebook, Inc. v. Power Ventures, Inc.*, 844 F.3d 1058 (9th Cir. 2016)) have upheld TOS violations when coupled with technical circumvention.

- **Data Privacy Regulations**  
  If data includes personal information, we must respect applicable privacy laws such as:  
  - **General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), EU 2016/679** – governs collection and processing of EU residents’ data.  
  - **California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.100** – applies to personal data of California residents.

2. Impact on Website Operations
Scraping can put stress on websites if it’s done recklessly. Pulling too much data too quickly can slow things down for regular users or even cause temporary outages. It can also get our IP blocked, which makes our project harder to run.

3. Privacy Considerations
Some of the data we collect may involve personal details like names or emails. We don’t want to gather more than we actually need, and when we do, we’ll take steps to keep that information safe. Sensitive info (like health or financial data) is off-limits unless there’s a clear legal and ethical reason to include it.

4. Our Team’s Ethical Framework  
- We’re open about what data we collect and why.  
- We only grab data that’s public and necessary for the project.    
- We hold ourselves accountable, meaning we’ll review what we’re doing and make changes if something feels off.

5. Alternative Approaches Considered  
- APIs - If a site already gives out data through an API, that’s the best route.  
- Open datasets - There are plenty of public data sources that are free to use.
