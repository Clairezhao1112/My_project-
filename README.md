Executive Summary
Picking classes at NYU can feel like guesswork. Students rely on RateMyProfessor reviews, but the site only shows overall ratings — it’s hard to see how a professor’s reputation changes over time. Our project solves this by scraping public RMP reviews for NYU professors, cleaning the data, and turning it into time-based trends. This gives students an easy way to see if a professor is improving, staying consistent, or trending downward before they register.  

For just $1 per semester, students get access to these insights in a simple, visual format. Advisors and departments could also use the aggregated data to better understand demand and help with course planning.
